Q.) What will be the output of the following code snippet?

#include <stdio.h>
void fun() {
   int a = 15, b = 25;
   int c = a + b;
   {
      int c = b - a;
      printf("%d ", c);
   }
   printf("%d", c);
}
int main() {
    fun();
    return 0;
}

Ans: 10 40
Option B

Explanation- First the statement (int c=b-a) will be executed and will give output 10 then the next statement(int c=a+b) will be executed and will give output 40 as local variable(c=a-b) is given first priority over the global variable (c=a+b)
This question is based on the concept of scopes. 
For the 1st printf statement, the value of local variable 'c' (b-a) will be printed since the statement is inside a block, i.e. 10 will be printed.
For the 2nd printf statement, the value of the global variable 'c' (a+b) will be printed since it is outside the block, i.e. 40 will be printed.
Thus the output will be -> 10  40
