Question :

 Complete the series -
3, 10, 29, 88, 263, __
A) 657
B) 790
C) 745
D) 719


Explanation:

Multiplying each number of the series with 3 and adding and subtracting 1 from the product alternatively. 

OR

The pattern in the series is 
(Previous no.)×3-(-1)^n
where, n=the position of the term

(3×3)+1 =9+1=10
(10×3)-1= 30-1=29
(29×3)+1=87+1=88
(88×3)-1=264-1=263
(263×3)+1=789+1=790
